Split large file with multiple lines

Sometimes, you need to split large file into smaller parts. For example, to retrieve sequences for list of Gene IDs using  batch entrez. A simple split command does the job.

split -l NN filename : where NN is the number of lines

Remove everything after certain character in a tabular formatted file

cut -f1 -d “,” filename > new_filename

This command will remove everything after “,” (comma) from the first column.

Remove everything before character

awk -F ‘char or string’ ‘{print $2}’ filename > new_filename

Remove empty lines

awk ‘NF’ filename > new_filename

Make a new table based on a string from original table

awk -F “\t” ‘/class_code=”u”/ {print $0}’ filename.gtf > new_filename.gtf

This will create a new .gtf file which list all  transcripts with class code “u” from original .gtf file.

Go to particular line number

sed -n ‘line_no’p filename

Edit/replace a line with different string

sed -i ‘/linenumber/.*/new_string/’ filename
