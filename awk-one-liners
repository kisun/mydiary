#Split large file with multiple lines

#Sometimes, you need to split large file into smaller parts. For example, to retrieve sequences for list of Gene IDs using  batch entrez. A simple split command does the job.

split -l NN filename : where NN is the number of lines

#Remove everything after certain character in a tabular formatted file

cut -f1 -d “,” filename > new_filename

#This command will remove everything after “,” (comma) from the first column.

#Remove everything before character

awk -F ‘char or string’ ‘{print $2}’ filename > new_filename

#Remove empty lines

awk ‘NF’ filename > new_filename

#Make a new table based on a string from original table

awk -F “\t” ‘/class_code=”u”/ {print $0}’ filename.gtf > new_filename.gtf

#This will create a new .gtf file which list all  transcripts with class code “u” from original .gtf file.

#Go to particular line number

sed -n ‘line_no’p filename

#Edit/replace a line with different string

sed -i ‘/linenumber/.*/new_string/’ filename

Remove everything before First Alphabet
such as 32_END_48_ACACGAT_L005_R1_001.fastq.gz to END_48_ACACGAT_L005_R1_001.fastq.gz

find $dir -type f | sed 's|\(.*/\)[^A-Z]*\([A-Z].*\)|mv \"&\" \"\1\2\"|' | sh

#Much better way to remove everything you don't want
for file in ./*.gz; do newname=$(echo $file | sed -re 's/^([^ACGT]+).*(R[1-3]).*/\1\2\.fastq\.gz/g'); mv $file $newname; done
with this, you can change 32_END_48_ACACGAT_L005_R1_001.fastq.gz to END_48_R1.fastq.gz
