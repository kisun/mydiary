###RNA-Seq Pipeline
============
The repository will contain all necessary methods for doing rna-seq data analysis. While most of the analyses were done using CSC cluster, some of the analysis were done in local computer.
============
The following are the different analyses that can be done using RNA-seq data.

###Basic Data analyses
**1. Quality control**
2. Mapping
3. Assembly/Quantification
4. Differential Expression


###Additional Analyses
6. Variant analysis
7. Splicing
8. Exon usage
