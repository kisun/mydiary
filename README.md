###RNA-Seq Pipeline
=============================================

The repository will contain all necessary methods for doing rna-seq data analysis. While most of the analyses were done using CSC cluster, some of the analysis were done in local computer.

The following are the different analyses that can be done using RNA-seq data.


Analysis steps
----------
###Basic Data analyses
<ul>
<li>Preparation</li>
<li>Quality control</li>
<li>Mapping</li>
<li>Assembly/Quantification</li>
<li>Differential Expression</li>
</ul>

###Additional Analyses
<ul start = 5>
<li>Variant analysis</li>
<li>Splicing</li>
<li>Exon usage</li>
</ul>
